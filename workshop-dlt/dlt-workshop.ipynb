    "### **‚ÄúA wild dataset Magically appears!‚Äù**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In many data science teams, data seems to appear out of nowhere ‚Äî because an engineer loads it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the well-known **NYC Taxi dataset** looks well-structured and ready to use, making it easy to query and analyze. However, not all datasets arrive in such a clean format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Well-structured data** (with an explicit schema) can be used immediately.  \n",
    "  - Examples: Parquet, Avro, or database tables where data types and structures are predefined.  \n",
    "- **Unstructured or weakly typed data** (without a defined schema) often needs cleaning and formatting first.  \n",
    "  - Examples: CSV, JSON, where fields might be inconsistent, nested or missing key details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **What is a schema?**  \n",

    "\n",
    "Data pipelines are the backbone of modern data-driven organizations, transforming raw, scattered data into actionable insights. \n",
    "They ensure data flows seamlessly from its source to its final destination, where it can drive decision-making, analytics, and innovation. \n",

    "![pipes](img/pipes.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What makes data pipelines so essential?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect**:  \n",
    "   Data pipelines gather information from a variety of sources, such as databases, data streams, and applications. This ensures no data is overlooked.  \n",
    "   - Example: Retrieving sales data from an online store or capturing user activity logs from an app.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ingest**:  \n",
    "   The collected data flows into an event queue, where it‚Äôs organized and prepared for the next steps.  \n",
    "   - **Structured data** (like Parquet files or database tables) can be processed immediately.  \n",
    "   - **Unstructured data** (like CSV or JSON files) often needs cleaning and normalization.  \n",
    "   - Example: Cleaning a JSON response by standardizing its fields or formatting dates in a CSV file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Store**:  \n",
    "   Pipelines send the processed data to **data lakes**, **data warehouses**, or **data lakehouses** for efficient storage and easy access.  \n",
    "   - Example: Storing marketing campaign data in a data warehouse to analyze its performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute**:  \n",
    "   Data is processed either in **batches** (large chunks) or as **streams** (real-time updates) to make it ready for analysis.  \n",
    "   - Example: Calculating monthly revenue or processing live stock market data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Consume**:  \n",
    "   Finally, the prepared data is delivered to users in forms they can act on:  \n",
    "   - **Dashboards** for executives and analysts.  \n",
    "   - **Self-service analytics tools** for teams exploring trends.  \n",

    "## **Extracting data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the data you‚Äôll work with is stored behind an **API**, which is like a doorway to the data. Here are the most common types:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **RESTful APIs**: Provide records of data from business applications.  \n",
    "  - Example: Getting a list of customers from a CRM system.  \n",
    "- **File-based APIs**: Return secure file paths to bulk data like JSON or Parquet files stored in buckets.  \n",
    "  - Example: Downloading monthly sales reports.  \n",
    "- **Database APIs**: Connect to databases like MongoDB or SQL, often returning data as JSON, the most common interchange format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an engineer, you will need to build pipelines that ‚Äújust work‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here‚Äôs what you need to consider on extraction, to prevent the pipelines from breaking, and to keep them running smoothly:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hardware limits**: Be mindful of memory (RAM) and storage (disk space). Overloading these can crash your system.  \n",
    "2. **Network reliability**: Networks can fail! Always account for retries to make your pipelines more robust.  \n",
    "   - Tip: Use libraries like `dlt` that have built-in retry mechanisms.  \n",
    "3. **API rate limits**: APIs often restrict the number of requests you can make in a given time.  \n",
    "   - Tip: Check the API documentation to understand its limits (e.g., [Zendesk](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/), [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are even more challenges to consider when working with APIs ‚Äî such as **pagination and authentication**. Let‚Äôs explore how to handle these effectively when working with **REST APIs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Working with REST APIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs (Representational State Transfer APIs) are one of the most common ways to extract data. They allow you to retrieve structured data using simple HTTP requests. However, working with APIs comes with its own challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Common Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "![rest_api](img/Rest_API.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Rate limits**  \n",
    "Many APIs **limit the number of requests** you can make within a certain time frame to prevent overloading their servers. If you exceed this limit, the API may **reject your requests** temporarily or even block you for a period.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid hitting these limits, we can:  \n",
    "- **Monitor API rate limits** ‚Äì Some APIs provide headers that tell you how many requests you have left.  \n",
    "- **Pause requests when needed** ‚Äì If we're close to the limit, we wait before making more requests.  \n",
    "- **Implement automatic retries** ‚Äì If a request fails due to rate limiting, we can wait and retry after some time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üí°Some APIs provide a **retry-after** header, which tells you how long to wait before making another request. Always check the API documentation for best practices!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Authentication**  \n",
    "Many APIs require an **API key or token** to access data securely. Without authentication, requests may be limited or denied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üîê **Types of Authentication in APIs:**  \n",
    "- **API Keys** ‚Äì A simple token included in the request header or URL.  \n",
    "- **OAuth Tokens** ‚Äì A more secure authentication method requiring user authorization.  \n",
    "- **Basic Authentication** ‚Äì Using a username and password (less common today).  \n",
    "\n",
    "üí° Never share your API token publicly! Store it in environment variables or use a secure secrets manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### **3. Pagination**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs return data in **chunks (or pages)** rather than sending everything at once. This prevents **overloading the server** and improves performance, especially for large datasets. To retrieve **all the data**, we need to make multiple requests and keep track of pages until we reach the last one.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå Example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this example, we‚Äôll request data from an API that serves the **NYC taxi dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these purposes we created an API that can serve the data you are already familiar with. The API returns **1,000 records per page**, and we must request multiple pages to retrieve the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "BASE_API_URL = \"https://us-central1-dlthub-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/data_engineering_zoomcamp_api\"\n",
    "\n",
    "page_number = 1\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    params = {'page': page_number}\n",
    "    response = requests.get(BASE_API_URL, params=params)\n",
    "    page_data = response.json()\n",
    "\n",
    "    if not page_data:\n",
    "        break\n",

    "    print(page_data)\n",
    "    page_number += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    # limit the number of pages for testing\n",
    "    if page_number > 2:\n",
    "      break\n",
    "```\n",
    "What happens here:\n",
    "- Starts at page 1 and makes a GET request to the API.\n",
    "- Retrieves JSON data and checks if the page contains records.\n",
    "- If data exists, prints it and moves to the next page.\n",
    "- If the page is empty, stops requesting more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° Different APIs handle pagination differently (some use offsets, cursors, or tokens instead of page numbers). Always check the API documentation for the correct method!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Avoiding memory issues during extraction**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent your pipeline from crashing, you need to control memory usage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Challenges with memory**  \n",
    "- Many pipelines run on systems with limited memory, like serverless functions or shared clusters.  \n",
    "- If you try to load all the data into memory at once, it can crash the entire system.  \n",
    "- Even disk space can become an issue if you‚Äôre storing large amounts of data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The solution: streaming data**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Streaming** means processing data in small chunks or events, rather than loading everything at once. This keeps memory usage low and ensures your pipeline remains efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data engineer, you‚Äôll use streaming to transfer data between buffers, such as:  \n",
    "- from APIs to local files;  \n",
    "- from Webhooks to event queues;  \n",
    "- from Event queues (like Kafka) to storage buckets.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **API documentation**:  \n",
